### Features
- **Character Movement (WASD)**: Built with max speed, acceleration, friction, and an air acceleration multiplier that modifies acceleration while the character is not grounded.
- **FreeLook 3rd Person Camera (mouse controlled)**: control view and character direction with Cinemachine.
- **Double Jump (spacebar) & Dash (left shift)**: Perform jumps and checkout the cooldown, duration, and force variables for the dash.
- **Coin Collection**: Pick up coins to increase the score.
- **Score Display**: UI updates to show collected coins.
- **Invisible Walls**: Don't fall off the map
- **Parkour Map Design**: Play a short, fun parkour map and try to collect all of the coins (hint: they're all collectible)

Note: The walls are sticky so the character can cling to them and bounce off! There is an attribution for the character model in `ATTRIBUTIONS.txt` in the models folder
